       broken.This was a gift for my Grand daughter, opened the box and it was broken. Was able to repair it with the help of some glue, but I may suggest better packing. Apart from that, it's a nice high chair for the money.   \n89952                                          Travel System is Different!.If you are like me, you have been waiting for the single travel system in this great pattern to be available. It's in the stores now, and I RAN to Babies R Us and was told the system was exactly like the car seat...I got it home and the system DOES NOT have the faux suede fabric like the car seat in the same pattern that is sold seperately. All that wonderful butter-soft tan suede is replaced by tan canvas. Sure, it will wear better, but if you had your heart set on everything matching the carseat (as I was), prepare yourself!   \n137963                                                                                                                                                     Good for a Laugh.The book starts off with a detailed lesson of the origin of blood types. The author used that to basically say we should eat what our ancestors ate, or at least food in the same groups. It shocked me to hear that, according to this book, Asians are consuming the wrong foods for their blood type. Most people I have seen from China and Japan are fit and healthy. The foods the book said should irritate my stomach don't and vice versa.   \n200992  a bit of a departure.A lot of people are not pleased with the direction the Blood Brothers took on this one. I guess they \"sold out\" or whatever. Having Ross Robinson produce their record could not have helped. Also there is more melody on this one, more actual singing instead of just yelling. That makes their music less angular, for better or worse. My opinion is that the tweaking of the formula worked, and I enjoy Burn Piano Island, Burn more than their previous records. The one dude still mutters and shouts, the other still squeaks and drawls, sounding like the singer of Tesla on uppers...   \n226197                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Good product, price is high.The tape itself is fine, but at over $6, I would expect more total material. In fact, I was able to find this same 3-pack in stores for 1/2 the price.   \n304569                                                                                        Terrible!.This is one of the most user UN-friendly devices I have ever purchased. I have several bluetooth devices which are easy to setup and work great. These headphones take a great deal of trial and error and guest work to set up. When I finally did get them up and running, the sound quality was very disappointing.I am amazed how (apparently) difficult it is to build good sounding stereo headphones (I could care less about stereo phonecalls). I would give this product \"0\" stars-but that is not an option.   \n372804                           THe Curious Wine - 1960's NC Homemake Women of Year Must Decide Between Family and Family?.Interesting look at the happenings in one women's life in 1960's North Carolina. Sort of an nearly-incentuous Bridges of Madison county. (don't have an affair with your husband's brother!) The 60's in the south was a turbulent place. Main character is pro-integration while most of the other characters are not. This is not a major theme but does occur and the objectionable word is present.Personally I don't think the brother is ever going to leave his wife for the main character.   \n193453                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Interesting Critique of Fundamentalism.It's rare to read a critique of fundamentalism from someone who actually understands its origins. Bawer understands it well, from Scofield to Lindsey to Robertson.   \n71463                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Paid for new received used,.I ordered this book mainly to bring my order over $25. I paid for a new book but received a used one. Customer service kindly refunded the charge. I was pleased with their prompt response. The book itself is not as cute as I expected based on description,   \n64629                                               Enthusiastic, but not scripturally sound.I'm not a Pentacostal, but I attend a Spirit-filled bible study (which I enjoy) where I was lent this book. The author insists many times that every believer can have all the spiritual gifts, contrary to scripture. He plays fast and loose with his interpretation of scripture. His categorizations of the gifts also seem somewhat arbitrary, and he leaves out gifts such as teaching and apostleship. I'm open to the spiritual gifts continuing today, but it's in spite of Les Sumrall's arguments, not because of them.   \n\n        Predictions  \n345212            2  \n89952             1  \n137963            2  \n200992            1  \n226197            2  \n304569            2  \n372804            1  \n193453            2  \n71463             2  \n64629             2  \n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#print(str(misclassified.sample(10)))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-26T22:32:40.065016Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-26T22:32:40.066313Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-26T22:32:40.071513Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-26T22:32:40.066261Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-26T22:32:40.070318Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":71,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n#%env AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=\"\"\n#%env AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=\"\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-26T22:22:14.182796Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-26T22:22:14.183259Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-26T22:22:14.191412Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-26T22:22:14.183224Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-26T22:22:14.190134Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":60,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"env: AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=\"4549967aa4154f4c9606d8c022a60c6d\"\nenv: AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=\"https://demobot.openai.azure.com/\"\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#!pip install langchain langchain-openai","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-26T22:26:34.286126Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-26T22:26:34.286581Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-26T22:26:34.292006Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-26T22:26:34.286539Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-26T22:26:34.290836Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":66,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain.schema import HumanMessage\nfrom langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI, AzureOpenAIEmbeddings\n\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"7a4c2900a7e94af18adb2302af9ce285\"\nos.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\"] = \"https://generalpurpose.openai.azure.com/\"\n\nmodel = AzureChatOpenAI(\n     openai_api_version=\"2023-07-01-preview\",\n     azure_deployment=\"gpt-4\",\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-26T22:27:06.077136Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-26T22:27:06.077552Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-26T22:27:06.117791Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-26T22:27:06.077518Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-26T22:27:06.116721Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":68,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_response(query, data):\n    message = HumanMessage(\n        content=\"Based on this data: \\n\"+data+\"\\n answer this question: \" + query\n    )\n    response = model([message])\n    return response.content","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-26T22:43:48.688848Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-26T22:43:48.689898Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-26T22:43:48.695281Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-26T22:43:48.689857Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-26T22:43:48.693938Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":86,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\ndata = str(misclassified.sample(10))\nquery= \"\"\"\nThe data you are seeing is from an analysis of the misclassification of my sentiment analysis model. \n// 1 is negative review and 2 is a positive review.\n// You can see the Reviews (labels) at the top, the models predictions at the bottom and ten examples of misclassification in the middle. \n// Give me examples from the text and highlight the potential misunderstanding and suggest are the three biggest reasons my model is predicting wrong?\n// Do not give me more information than this.
